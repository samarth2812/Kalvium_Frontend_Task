## The Problem Statement:

Students have a hectic schedule, which makes it tougher for them to keep a track of attendance at the same time. People cannot place all upcoming holidays, important leave registrations, and locating faculty when studying in a humongous university.
## Goal: To enhance the design and add features that benefit the user.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
## Features of this web app
## The simplified login feature:
Since the university uses the register number for everything within the campus it is safe and easier for users to use the same information even on the app.
## Uncluttered homepage: 
The home screen has the attendance percentage as the most important information. The most important information like the classes attended and number of days for absence left is the second most important information. I added the upcoming events information here too in order to make it easier for the user to look through upcoming leaves also. These were deemed as the most important information for a user and bringing it on the homepage is essential for the user.
## Smart Features:
Enables the student to mark the attendance via a QR makking it hasslefree.
Keeping in mind the authentic and true feature, it trackes the geolocation of student and only enables if within 10m of QR.
A reminder feature on timetable was added so that the users can have a seamless experience (and yknow not miss classes).
